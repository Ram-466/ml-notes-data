# NumPy Basics

NumPy provides fast numerical arrays for scientific computing and Machine Learning.

Unlike Python lists, NumPy arrays:
- Store elements of the same data type
- Are stored in contiguous memory
- Support vectorized operations
- Are significantly faster for numerical computation

## 1. Creating Arrays

```python
import numpy as np

a = np.array([1, 2, 3])
